    <h2>Manna</h2>
    <p>
        My current workplace is Manna Natural Cosmetics Ltd. (manna.hu), which is a hungarian multinational company that deals with natural cosmetics through their webshop and resellers.
        <br />
        The company was founded in 2010, and today it is already present in 8 different countries, such as The United Kingdom, Germany and Poland.
        <br />
        With thousands of active everyday users from multiple countries, Manna requires a strong and durable Webshop environment. My role as a fullstack PHP developer at Manna is to develop new features & modules, create campaigns, fix bugs and to keep the webshop up-to-date.

    <h2>Kinda Europe Kft.</h2>
    <p>
        My sister founded her company Kinda Europe Kft (kindaclothing.eu) in 2020. november. Kinda is selling self designed, custom tailored clothing. Currently several thousands of active users are browsing our site on a daily base, and we receive around 500 to 1000 orders per month.
        <br />

        The Webshop is 100% my work: from UI & UX design to coding I’m responsible for the whole project. I consider this as one of the most complex projects of mine: with custom payment & billing system, administration panel, integrated analytics and email marketing.
