            <span class="kezdobetu">M</span>y current workplace is Manna Natural Cosmetics Ltd. (manna.hu), which is a hungarian multinational company that deals with natural cosmetics through their webshop and resellers.
            <br />
            The company was founded in 2010, and today it is already present in 8 different countries, such as The United Kingdom, Germany and Poland.
            <br />
            With thousands of active everyday users from multiple countries, Manna requires a strong and durable Webshop environment. My role as a fullstack PHP developer at Manna is to develop new features & modules, create campaigns, fix bugs and to keep the webshop up-to-date.

            The Webshop is 100% my work: from UI & UX design to coding I’m responsible for the whole project. I consider this as one of the most complex projects of mine: with custom payment & billing system, administration panel, integrated analytics and email marketing.
